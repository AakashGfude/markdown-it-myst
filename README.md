**Overview & Goals**
* Provide a javascript implementation of [MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io) markdown extensions
  * Uses standard html for all known roles and directives, with no styling enforced
* Provide some functionality for cross referencing that is usually completed by Sphinx (in the python implementation)
